# Implementation Plan: Inseme Modernization & SaaS Evolution
This plan outlines the modernization of Inseme, its transformation into a reusable package, and its evolution into a full SaaS platform.
## Project Strategy: Three Support Modes
### 1. Mode: Package (`@inseme/core`)
- **Target**: Developers building democratic tools (ex: Kudocracy).
- **Artifact**: `src/package/inseme/`.
- **Status**: Ready. Exported via `index.jsx`.
- **Customization**: Uses Slot-based architecture for UI overrides.
### 2. Mode: Standalone App
- **Target**: Dedicated assembly sites for specific organizations.
- **Artifact**: The root React application.
- **Status**: Ready. Uses file-based prompts and environment variables.
### 3. Mode: SaaS (Service as a Software)
- **Target**: Multi-tenant platform for general public use.
- **Architecture**: Database-driven configuration per room.
- **Status**: Planned (Phase 6).
---
## Technical Architecture
### Core Logic (The "Protocol")
All assembly commands (`?`, `!`, `parole`, etc.) and state management are encapsulated in `InsemeProvider` and `useInseme`.
### AI Mediation (Ophélia)
- **Edge Functions**: Stateless processing in `netlify/edge-functions/ophelia.js`.
- **Dynamic Prompts**: System prompt can be loaded from a file (Standalone) or a Database (SaaS).
- **Vocal Output**: Native TTS integration with configurable voices.
### Media & Video
- **Jitsi Meet**: Integrated via `@jitsi/react-sdk`.
- **Embeds**: Support for YouTube, Pad, Images via `ModernMediaLayer`.
---
## Phase 6: SaaS Architecture (Multi-Tenancy)
### Database Schema
We will introduce a registry to manage room identities and custom settings.
#### [NEW] `inseme_rooms` Table
- `id`: `uuid` (primary key)
- `slug`: `text` (unique, e.g., 'bastille-2024')
- `owner_id`: `uuid` (links to `auth.users`)
- `name`: `text` (formal name of the assembly)
- `settings`: `jsonb` (Ophélia prompt, voice, Jitsi config, UI theme)
- `created_at`: `timestamptz`
### Dashboard Implementation
- **My Rooms**: List of rooms owned by the user.
- **Room Studio**: UI to configure Ophélia's personality and voice.
### Hook & Edge Adaptation
- **useInseme**: Will attempt to fetch data from `inseme_rooms` if a `slug` is provided.
- **Ophélia API**: Will accept a `room_slug` to fetch specific AI instructions from the DB instead of `inseme.md`.
---
## Phase 7: SaaS Marketing & Deployment
### Deployment Automation
We will provide scripts to automate instance setup in `/scripts/`:
- `setup-standalone.sh`: Configures environment and database for a dedicated organization.
- `setup-saas.sh`: Initializes the multi-tenant registry and security policies.
### SaaS Entry Flow
- **Landing Page**: A high-conversion landing page at the root URL.
- **Lead Management**: Integration with an external lead system (CRM/Web-hook) to capture interest from potential SaaS clients.
### Lead Management Service
- A `src/lib/leads.js` utility to handle data transmission to the lead system.
### Authentication Enhancements
- **Email/Password**:
    - Update `Login.jsx` with a toggle for "Email" vs "Social/Anonymous".
    - Implement `signInWithPassword` and `signUp` in `AuthModal.jsx`.
    - Handle auth errors (e.g., "User already registered", "Invalid login") gracefully.
- **Nickname Strategy**:
    - Add "Pseudonyme" field to `Login.jsx`.
    - Store nickname in `auth.users` metadata (`full_name`).
    - Pass metadata during `signUp` and `signInAnonymously`.
    - Add UI in `Chat.jsx` (Header) to call `supabase.auth.updateUser()` for on-the-fly name changes.
---
---
## Phase 8: Hybrid Participation (Voice-to-Text)
### Lean Transcription Flow
- **Silent Mode**: Client-side mute for Ophélia (TTS).
- **STT (Speech-to-Text)**:
    - Micro snippets sent to `/api/transcribe` (Whisper).
    - Result stored as a **standard message** with `type: 'transcription'`.
    - Ensures absolute traceability and accessibility.
- **Rich Media Support (URLs)**:
    - Automatic parsing of URLs in messages.
    - Previews/Tags stored in `metadata` for rich rendering of external references.
---
## Phase 9: Governance & Unified Minutes (PV)
Everything is archived in `inseme_messages` using `type` and `metadata`.
- **Unified Message Families**:
    - **Communication**: `chat`, `transcription`, `link` (URLs).
    - **Governance**: `agenda_point`, `proposition`, `vote_result`, `speech_grant`.
    - **Intelligence**: `system_summary`, `knowledge_anchor`, `session_boundary`.
- **PV Generation**: An AI synthesis function reconstructs the assembly from these typed events.
### Ophélia Prompt Layering
1. **Core Inseme Protocol (Pre-prompt)**: Immutable rules for message tagging, tool usage, and assembly lifecycle.
2. **Room Persona (Configurable)**: User-defined tone, voice, and mediation style managed via the SaaS Dashboard.
---
## Phase 10: Session Continuity
### Recursive Chaining
### Single Stream Continuity (Checkpoints)
- **Concept**: We stay in the same room. The "Procès-Verbal" (PV) acts as a **Session Boundary**.
- **Context Injection**:
    - When Ophélia is triggered, she queries the *same room's history* for the **most recent** message of `type: 'report'`.
    - This report is injected into the system prompt as "Previous Session Context".
- **Benefit**: No complex room linking. The history acts as the single source of truth.
---
## Phase 11: Nested Assemblies (Commissions)
- **Hierarchy Strategy**: Use `settings.parent_slug` in `inseme_rooms` (JSONB) to define the Plenary room.
- **Workflow**:
    1.  Commission debates a specific topic.
    2.  Ophélia generates a **PV** (Report).
    3.  **Promotion**: New tool `promote_to_plenary`.
    4.  Ophélia writes the PV into the **Parent Room** as a `type: 'proposition'`.
- **UI**: Visual indicator in `Chat.jsx` if the room has a parent ("Commission de [Parent]").
---
## Phase 12: Multilingual Agora (Pivot Strategy)
- **Concept**:
    - **Native Language**: User preference (e.g., 'Corsican').
    - **Pivot Language**: Room setting (e.g., 'French').
- **Workflow (Translate-on-Write)**:
    1.  User sends message in **Native**.
    2.  If Native != Pivot, client calls `/api/translate`.
    3.  **Storage**:
        - `message`: Translated content (in Pivot).
        - `metadata.original`: Original content.
        - `metadata.lang`: Source language code.
- **Control Commands**:
    - `inseme lang [code]`: Sets user's **Native Language** (e.g., `inseme lang co`).
    - `inseme pivot [code]`: Sets room's **Pivot Language** (e.g., `inseme pivot fr`).
- **Workflow (Translate-on-Write)**:
    1.  User sends message.
    2.  System checks local `nativeLang` vs room `pivotLang`.
    3.  If different, calls `/api/translate`.
    4.  Stores translated text + metadata `{ original, lang }`.
- **UI**:
    - Tags in chat: "[Traduit de CO]"
    - Toggle to show original.
---
## Phase 13: Governance Export & Vector Readiness
- **Universal Export**: Generate formal PVs in **Markdown** and **PDF**.
- **Semantic Memory (pgvector)**: 
    - **Schema**: Add `embedding vector(1536)` to `inseme_messages`.
    - **Knowledge Anchors**: New message type `knowledge_anchor`. Used to store document chunks or past decision summaries with their embeddings.
    - **Retrieval**: Ophélia can use a `semantic_search` tool to fetch relevant anchors from history to answer specific legal or historical questions.
---
## Phase 14: Session Lifecycle & Presence (The "Living Room")
- **Real-time Presence**:
    - Use Supabase Presence to track connected users.
    - **Notifications**: "X joined", "Y left" (ephemeral or system messages).
    - **Empty Room Logic**: If count drops to 0, trigger automatic "Session Checkpoint" (PV generation and archiving).
- **Formal Lifecycle**:
    - **Commands**: 
        - `inseme open` ("La séance est ouverte") -> Marks Session Start.
        - `inseme close` ("La séance est close") -> Marks Session End + Trigger PV.
    - **Ophélia Awareness**: System prompt updated with "Session Status" (Open/Closed). She nudges users to open the session before debating.
- **Session Browser**:
    - "History" view in Chat to list past sessions (identified by `type: 'report'` timestamps).
    - Clicking a past session loads its context.
---
## Phase 15: Deep History & Oracle Tools
- **Goal**: Enable Ophélia to answer precise questions about the past ("Quem a dit X le 12/12?", "Combien de votes pour le budget?").
- **Tools**:
    - `consult_archives`: A structured query tool (FTS) to search raw logs.
    - **Features**: Filters by Agent (User), Date Range, Message Type, and Keyword.
- **Data Persistence**:
    - **Tracking**: Clients automatically log a `type: 'presence_log'` message upon joining (`useEffect` mount) and leaving (`beforeunload`).
    - **Privacy**: These logs are hidden from the main Chat UI but accessible to Ophélia.
- **Backend**:
    - New Edge Function `/api/history` (or extending `vector-search`).
    - New Edge Function `/api/history` (or extending `vector-search`).
    - Uses Supabase `textSearch` and filter builders.
---
## Phase 16: Liquid Roles & Conflict Mediation
- **Philosophy**: "Roles are performed, not assigned." No hard-coded permissions.
- **Mechanism**:
    - **Open Access**: Any participant can trigger `inseme open/close`.
    - **Anomaly Detection**:
        - Ophélia monitors the logs for rapid state flips (Open -> Close -> Open).
        - She monitors for "coherence breaks" (e.g., closing while a vote is active).
    - **Mediation**:
        - If an anomaly occurs, Ophélia intervenes: "It seems there is confusion about the session status."
        - She encourages users to self-attribute roles: "Who is chairing today?"
- **Implementation**:
    - Remove any "Owner only" checks for lifecycle commands.
    - Update Ophélia's prompt to detect *social* conflicts rather than just enforcing rules.
---
## Phase 17: Operational Usability (Real-Life Ready)
- **Goal**: Remove friction for non-technical users.
- **Living Agenda**:
    - **Concept**: A dynamic list of points (`items`) that structures the debate.
    - **Data**: Stored in `inseme_messages` as `type: 'agenda_update'` (snapshot of the full list).
    - **UI**: A sticky "Agenda" panel. Clicking an item sets it as "Current Topic".
    - **Ophélia**: Contextual awareness ("We are discussing item 3, please save that for item 4").
- **Zero-Command Mobile UI**:
    - **Action Bar**: Fixed bottom bar on mobile with big touch targets.
    - **Buttons**:
        - ✋ **Parole**: Toggles request.
        - 🗳️ **Voter**: Opens a vote drawer/modal.
        - 🚪 **Bye**: Quick delegation flow.
    - **Simplification**: Hide complex slash commands behind visual metaphors.
---
## Phase 18: Documentation & Marketing Polish
- **Goal**: Align the branding with the "Liquid Democracy" philosophy.
- **Updates**:
    - **Landing Page**: Rebrand as "L'Agora Vivante". Highlight "Human Sovereignty" and "AI Mediation".
    - **README**: Define the "Protocol for Human Assembly".
    - **Walkthrough**: Conclude with the vision of the "Organic Assembly".
---
## Phase 19: Collective Intelligence & Analytics
- **Goal**: Provide organizations with deep insights into their democratic health.
- **Participation Metrics**:
    - Real-time heatmaps of engagement.
    - Diversity of speech tracking (ensuring minority voices are heard).
- **Consensus Analytics**:
    - Sentiment analysis of the room over time.
    - Identification of "bottleneck" topics that require mediation.
- **Dashboard**: A dedicated "Intelligence" tab in the SaaS portal.
---
## Phase 20: API & Ecosystem Integrations
- **Goal**: Turn Inseme into a platform for other democratic tools.
- **Webhooks**: Notify external apps (Discord, Slack, Notion) of final decisions or report generation.
- **External Tools API**: Allow developers to build custom "Inseme Tools" (e.g., a specific budget calculator).
- **OAuth Support**: Securely integrate with organizational identities.
---
## Phase 21: Enterprise SaaS & Sustainability
- **Goal**: Ensure the long-term viability of the platform.
- **Billing & Subscriptions**:
    - Stripe integration for "Premium" rooms (unlimited history, custom LLM models).
    - Free tier for grassroots collectives.
- **White Labeling**: Allow organizations to use custom domains and themes.
- **SLA & Compliance**: GDPR-compliant data handling and export tools.
---
## Phase 22: Conclusion: Towards the Global Agora
- **Goal**: Scale the "Organic Assembly" to the world.
- **Global Search**: Discover public assemblies and join as a guest/observer.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Optional archival to IPFS for immutable democratic records.
- **Final Vision**: A global network of interlinked assemblies, mediated by AI but governed by humans.
---
## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- **Auth Flow**: Verify anonymous and social logins.
- **Sync Test**: Multi-tab synchronization of votes and chat.
- **Package Test**: Verify `@inseme/core` can be imported by an external mock.
- **Edge Logic**: Unit tests for transcription and translation edge functions.
### SaaS Validation
- **Multi-tenant Test**: Create two rooms with different Ophélia prompts and verify their behaviors independently.
- **Ownership Test**: Verify only owners can edit room settings via RLS.
- **Billing Flow**: Mock Stripe checkout and verify room feature activation.
### Human-in-the-Loop (QA)
- **Mediation Stress Test**: Simulate a heated debate and verify Ophélia's conflict resolution triggers.
- **Zero-Command UX**: Conduct a user test with non-technical participants using only the Mobile Action Bar.
