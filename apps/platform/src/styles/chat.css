/* chat.css — placeholder for truly shared chat utilities
   Most chat-specific styles have been migrated to component-local
   `src/components/bob/v2/chat-v2.css` as part of the componentization migration.

   Keep this file minimal and only include classes that are reused
   across multiple pages/components (if any).
