# 📖 @inseme/brique-wiki - Collaborative Knowledge Base

**@inseme/brique-wiki** is the collective memory and documentation module for the Inseme monorepo.
It enables federated knowledge sharing and collaborative editing.

This module allows communities to build a shared repository of information, ranging from municipal
reports to neighborhood guides and practical local knowledge.

> For an overview of the ecosystem (Agora, IA, Multi-instances), see the
> [global repository README](../../README.md).
