# 🗳️ @inseme/brique-kudocracy - Voting & Liquid Democracy

**@inseme/brique-kudocracy** is the core governance and decision-making engine for the Inseme
monorepo. It implements advanced voting systems and liquid democracy principles.

This module allows communities to propose ideas, debate them, and reach consensus through various
voting mechanisms and delegation systems.

> For an overview of the ecosystem (Agora, IA, Multi-instances), see the
> [global repository README](../../README.md).

## 🎯 What is it for?

It provides the tools necessary for modern, transparent, and scalable collective decision-making.

### 1. 💡 Proposition Management

Citizens can create, edit, and search for propositions. Each proposition serves as a focal point for
debate and consensus-building.

### 2. 💧 Liquid Democracy

Implements dynamic vote delegation, allowing citizens to trust experts or peers on specific topics
while retaining the ability to vote directly at any time.

### 3. 🛡️ Rule-Based Governance

Uses a logic-based engine (Prolog-compatible) to manage complex governance rules, ensuring that
every vote and delegation follows the community's established charter.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Delegation Manager**: Interface to manage trusted delegates and topical delegations.
- **AI Recommendation**: Ophélia-assisted voting recommendations based on past preferences and group
  consensus.
- **Governance Settings**: Customizable rules for voting thresholds, periods, and delegation chains.
