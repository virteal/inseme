# Magistral Capability Resolution Boundary

## 1. Decision

Magistral is not conceptually limited to Large Language Model routing.

Its stable architectural role is:

> **Magistral is the capability-resolution and access boundary between orchestration and concrete work capabilities.**

The existing OpenAI-compatible model router remains a valid and useful first implementation slice. It MUST NOT be mistaken for the full abstraction.

Compact formulation:

```text
COP orchestrates work.
Magistral resolves and presents capabilities.
Fractanet makes capabilities present.
```

Magistral MUST preserve the authority semantics defined by [`COP_MANDATED_AGENT_SECURITY.md`](../cop-core/COP_MANDATED_AGENT_SECURITY.md):

```text
operational autonomy != autonomous authority
```

## 2. Separation of concerns

COP may express that a continuation or task requires a capability without naming a concrete provider, machine, protocol, model, or process.

Magistral resolves that requirement against capabilities currently reachable in Fractanet and selects an admissible access path according to constraints and policy.

Fractanet is the distributed field in which those capabilities are present: local processes, remote services, machines, humans, agents, models, databases, sensors, actuators, or future forms of compute.

```text
COP
  CapabilityRequirement
        |
        v
Magistral
  discovery / arbitration / binding / adapter selection
        |
        v
Fractanet capability
  HandlerInstance / service / process / human / machine
```

Magistral does not create authority. A capability offer or successful invocation proves neither a Mandate nor entitlement to use the capability.

A resolution MUST NOT widen the mandate carried by the requesting work. Provider capabilities are an upper bound on what can technically be done, never a grant of what may legitimately be done.

## 3. Generalizing BLUEPRINT / MAP / PILOT

The existing Magistral tripartite architecture remains useful when generalized beyond models.

### BLUEPRINT — what can be done

A Blueprint describes a class of capability and its relevant properties. Blueprints describe capability, not authority.

Examples include semantic embedding, chat synthesis, coding agents, repository review, vision inference, speech transcription, human review and Inox execution.

### MAP — where capability is presently available

A Map binds capability offers to reachable Fractanet locations or providers. A Map entry may include cost, latency, locality, trust domain, credentials regime, concurrency, health, energy, jurisdiction, or other operational properties.

### PILOT — how a capability is selected

A Pilot resolves a `CapabilityRequirement` against available offers. Selection may consider required features, mandate-compatible scope, budget, cost bearer, latency, locality, availability, quality, confidence, privacy, trust domain, energy, jurisdiction, reversibility, session affinity and continuation portability.

The Pilot may use fallback, competition, racing, quorum, or synthesis policies when appropriate. Selection is not authorization: every selected path remains bounded by the exact authority chain of the work.

## 4. CapabilityRequirement

Magistral SHOULD accept a provider-neutral requirement rather than forcing COP to name a concrete runtime.

Illustrative shape:

```yaml
capability: coding-agent
input:
  continuation_ref: cop:continuation:...
constraints:
  repository: inseme
  writable_scope:
    - packages/foo/**
  budget_ref: budget:...
  mandate_ref: mandate:...
  mandate_version: ...
  principal_ref: subject:...
  deadline: ...
preferences:
  locality: prefer-local
  portability: required
```

This is informative, not yet a normative wire schema.

Before a consequential effect, the selected adapter MUST re-evaluate the pinned mandate version when the execution interval permits mandate state to have changed.

## 5. Invocation contracts are capability-specific

Different capabilities have different interaction semantics. Magistral therefore needs a generic notion of **InvocationAdapter** rather than one universal HTTP shape.

OpenAI-compatible endpoints remain a valuable adapter family for service-like intelligence.

No adapter MAY interpret transport success, provider authentication or technical reachability as authority to perform an engaging act.

## 6. ACP, A2A, MCP and other surfaces

Execution protocols are below the Magistral boundary: OpenAI-compatible HTTP, provider-native APIs, ACP, A2A, MCP, CLI/stdio, Inox-native and future adapters.

Their roles are not identical. The execution surface MUST NOT determine the authority relation.

Magistral as an ACP provider MUST expose only the capabilities admitted by its current configuration and governing Mandate. It MUST NOT silently grant a remote ACP client the account authority, local filesystem access or private agent memory associated with a selected inner capability.

An outer ACP session may resolve work to an inner session, but the outer session MUST retain its own principal, mandate version, capability binding, budget and receipt references.

## 7. Coding agents as high-value capabilities

Coding agents are rich capabilities combining reasoning, repository navigation, editing, shell execution, tools, planning and iterative interaction. Magistral SHOULD represent them as such rather than pretending they are only models behind a conversational endpoint.

A compatibility projection MAY lose semantics. It MUST NOT become the canonical representation of portable work state.

The existing ACP implementation and capability catalog remain valid first slices. Their caller remains responsible for mandate and budget authority and for recording the resulting receipt.

## 8. Anti-capture and continuation portability

Vendor sessions MAY be used as execution accelerators but SHOULD NOT own the canonical state of a portable task.

Where portability is required, the durable state needed to continue work must be externalized into COP Events, Artifacts, Continuations, repository state, or other reconstructible Fractanet memory.

The desired property is reconfigurable continuity across providers and nodes while preserving LogicalAgent, principal, Mandate, budget bearer and causal lineage.

Capacity portability is stronger than data export. A continuation that exports text but loses the authority boundary, evidence, budget state or safe recovery semantics is not fully portable.

On rebinding to a new provider or node, local credentials MUST be re-authorised. Imported state MUST NOT itself confer local authority.

## 9. Relationship to current Magistral implementation

The current implementation centred on `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, provider health, routing and fallback remains valid.

The evolution is additive:

```text
model routing
    subset of
capability resolution
    bounded by
governed authority
```

No rewrite is implied. New capability classes and invocation adapters should be added incrementally and tested through reversible vertical slices.

## 10. Mandated-agent vertical slice

The next security-oriented vertical slice SHOULD test:

1. COP emits a portable continuation requiring `coding-agent`, with principal, mandate version and budget.
2. Magistral discovers at least two distinct offers.
3. One offer executes bounded work and emits trace, artifacts and continuation.
4. The first HandlerInstance is discarded.
5. Magistral resolves the continuation to a different agent or node.
6. The second agent resumes under the same logical authority chain but newly bound local credentials.
7. A deliberate attempt by either agent to widen writable scope or budget is rejected.
8. Revocation between planning and effect causes re-evaluation and rejection.
9. COP replay reconstructs the causal chain across both executions.

Success is **portable continuation under preserved authority, identity, budget and causal lineage**, including failure of self-elevation attempts.

## 11. ACP provider vertical slice

After the ACP-client slice is reliable, Magistral SHOULD expose one bounded ACP-provider slice in which an external client initializes a session, the session is bound to a constrained `CapabilityRequirement` and exact Mandate version, an admissible offer is selected, progress is normalized, and cancellation, closure, failure and artifacts produce explicit receipts.

A test MUST verify that the client cannot obtain implicit access to the inner agent's account, filesystem, private memory, ungoverned tools, broader mandate or budget.

## 12. Conformance dependency

Any Magistral deployment claiming governed consequential capability resolution SHOULD declare conformance with `cop/mandated-agent-security` and execute the minimum tests defined in `COP_MANDATED_AGENT_SECURITY.md`.

## 13. Use-led integration policy

Magistral MUST NOT accumulate provider integrations merely because implementations appear on the market.

The default sequence is:

```text
real need
-> capability already useful in practice
-> smallest integration that satisfies the need
-> repeated friction or second real implementation
-> reusable abstraction
-> possible promotion toward the stable boundary
```

Compact rule:

> **Integrate from use; generalize from experience.**

A protocol, framework or vendor is not by itself a reason to enter the core. ACP is an example of the intended direction: a real Codex use preceded the abstraction; the protocol then made that already useful capability more general and replaceable.

The inverse pattern is discouraged:

```text
new framework
-> speculative adapter
-> maintenance burden
-> search for a use
```

## 14. Three integration levels

Magistral distinguishes three levels so that portability does not force every rich runtime into the lowest common denominator.

### Level 1 — Capability requirement/provider

COP expresses the capability needed. A `CapabilityProvider` advertises that it can satisfy some class of requirement. Neither side depends on a transport protocol.

### Level 2 — Common execution surface

A common protocol such as ACP, MCP, A2A, HTTP or another negotiated surface MAY bind a provider when it preserves the semantics needed by the actual use.

### Level 3 — Native execution surface

A provider-native API, app server, CLI, SDK or other richer surface MAY be used when a capability that matters in practice cannot be represented adequately at Level 2.

Therefore:

> **Use the most generic surface that preserves the capability actually needed; descend to a vendor-native surface only for demonstrated semantic value.**

This is not vendor avoidance. It is dependency proportionality.

## 15. Provider, binding and adapter

The stable vocabulary SHOULD distinguish the entity providing useful work from the mechanism used to reach it:

```text
CapabilityRequirement
        |
        v
CapabilityProvider
        |
        v
ExecutionBinding
        |
        v
TransportAdapter
```

A provider may have several bindings. The same transport adapter may reach several providers. A binding may be replaced without changing the logical requirement or authority chain.

Examples:

```text
Codex                  = CapabilityProvider
ACP                    = possible TransportAdapter / execution surface
Codex native AppServer = possible richer TransportAdapter
Magistral              = provider + binding resolution
COP                     = authority / causality / accounting
```

These examples are informative, not permanent product commitments.

## 16. Rule of Two for core abstractions

A candidate abstraction SHOULD NOT enter the stable core merely because one implementation suggests it.

Default promotion rule:

> **A new abstraction becomes a core candidate when at least two independent real implementations or uses reveal substantially the same need.**

This is a heuristic, not an absolute prohibition. Security invariants, legal constraints or exceptionally costly future incompatibility MAY justify earlier promotion, but the exception SHOULD be documented.

The Rule of Two is intended to resist both premature generalization and accidental vendor-shaped architecture.

## 17. Capability seams and optional semantics

The generic provider seam SHOULD remain deliberately small. Candidate common lifecycle operations include:

```text
discover
start
send / continue
observe events
cancel
dispose
```

Additional semantics such as checkpoint/resume, fork, structured diffs, rich approvals, artifacts, terminal ownership or provider-specific state SHOULD be represented as negotiated/optional capabilities rather than assumed universal operations until real use proves otherwise.

A common protocol is therefore a projection of a capability, not necessarily its complete representation.

## 18. Ownership is distinct from authority

For every consequential or persistent execution, the architecture SHOULD be able to distinguish at least:

```text
authority owner   -> source of legitimate authority / Principal and Mandate
execution owner   -> entity responsible for cancel/dispose lifecycle
resource owner    -> entity bearing or controlling resource consumption
runtime owner     -> node/process/provider hosting execution
artifact owner    -> policy governing durable outputs and retention
```

These roles MAY coincide but MUST NOT be assumed identical.

In particular, lifecycle ownership MUST NOT imply authority ownership, and provider account ownership MUST NOT silently become Principal authority.

## 19. Continuity state is not authority state

Fork, resume, import and migration MUST preserve a strict distinction:

```text
portable continuity state != portable privilege
```

A fork MAY reuse validated conversation or work state. It MUST NOT automatically inherit broader scope, tools, credentials, filesystem rights, budgets or authority merely because those were available to its parent runtime.

Any authority required after migration or fork MUST be re-derived from the governing Mandate and, where local privilege is involved, explicitly rebound.

This extends the anti-capture rule from vendor portability to runtime composition itself.

## 20. Evidence-driven evolution

Magistral SHOULD watch external agent systems primarily as experimental evidence, not as an integration queue.

Useful observations include independently recurring patterns such as durable sessions, event streams, capability discovery, bidirectional approvals, explicit scope, lifecycle ownership, structured cancellation, subagent-provider seams, forks without automatic authority inheritance and protocol capability negotiation.

When a recurring pattern solves a problem already observed in Inseme/COP, it SHOULD be recorded as evidence for an existing or candidate abstraction. When it does not serve an observed need, no implementation obligation follows.

The objective is not to support every agent system. It is to make useful agent systems substitutable where substitution increases the Principal's effective capacity and sovereignty.
