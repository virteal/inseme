# 💬 @inseme/brique-ophelia - Ophélia Vocal Chat & AI Moderator

**@inseme/brique-ophelia** is the "Organic Assembly" protocol and AI-assisted moderation engine for
the Inseme monorepo. It provides a real-time democratic space where roles are performed, not
assigned.

Designed for **Liquid Democracy**, it replaces rigid permissions with AI-assisted mediation,
allowing any group—from Municipal Councils to Co-ownerships—to self-organize, debate, and trace
decisions without bureaucracy.

> For an overview of the ecosystem (Agora, IA, Multi-instances), see the
> [global repository README](../../README.md).

## 🎯 What is it for?

Ophélia acts as a "Living Record" and a mirror for the group, ensuring transparency and continuity
in collective discussions.

### 1. 🛡️ Human-First Moderation

No hard-coded permissions. Anyone can open a session. The group decides legitimacy, while the AI
observes and highlights potential conflicts.

### 2. 🤖 AI as Mirror (Ophélia)

Ophélia observes, validates coherence, and archives history, but never commands. She can answer "Who
was here yesterday?" or "What was the decision on X?".

### 3. 📜 Traceability

Every action (Vote, Speech, Presence) is logged to build an unalterable history, enabling the
generation of Official Reports and deep-text search on raw logs.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **InsemeRoom**: A full-featured assembly room component with native Jitsi Meet integration.
- **Liquid Roles**: Conflict detection instead of permission denial.
- **Liquid Voting**: Dynamic vote delegation (`bye` command).
- **Oracle Mode**: Ask questions about past sessions or current consensus.
