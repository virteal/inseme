# 🧠 @inseme/cop-kernel - COP Runtime & Orchestration

**@inseme/cop-kernel** is the runtime engine for the Cognitive Orchestration Protocol (COP) in the
Inseme monorepo. It provides the essential infrastructure for managing agents, nodes, and their
interactions.

Built on top of `cop-core`, the kernel handles the practical execution of the protocol, ensuring
that various components can communicate and collaborate effectively.

> [global repository README](../../README.md).

> For the implementation-profile status of this package, see [`PROFILE.md`](PROFILE.md).

## 🎯 What is it for?

It serves as the "Operating System" for the Inseme ecosystem, providing the runtime helpers and
registries needed for a decentralized, AI-assisted platform.

### 1. 🤖 Agent & Node Management

Utilities for defining, registering, and managing the lifecycle of autonomous agents and protocol
nodes.

### 2. 📋 Service Registry

A centralized registry for discovering and interacting with available services and capabilities
within the ecosystem.

### 3. 🔄 Interaction Orchestration

Helpers for managing complex multi-agent interactions and ensuring protocol compliance across the
runtime.
