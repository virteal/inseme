# COP Protocol Invariants

This document defines the **non-negotiable invariants** of the Cognitive Orchestration Protocol
(COP).

Any system claiming COP compliance MUST preserve these invariants.

They are architectural constraints, not implementation suggestions.

---

## 1. Immutability

**Traces, Events, Artifacts, and EvidenceRelations are immutable.**

Once created:

- a TraceRef or TraceDescriptor MUST never be modified or deleted,
- an Event MUST never be modified or deleted,
- an Artifact MUST never be modified or deleted,
- an EvidenceRelation MUST never be modified or deleted.

Corrections, updates, or reversals MUST be expressed as **new Events** or **new EvidenceRelations**.
Assertions can be superseded or marked disputed, but their historical assertion records are never erased.

Immutability guarantees:

- auditability,
- causal reasoning,
- deterministic replay and reconstructibility,
- long-term integrity.

---

## 2. Topic-Local Ordering

All Events belong to exactly one **Topic**.

Within a Topic:

- Events are totally ordered by a monotonically increasing `topicSeq`,
- ordering MUST be strict and gap-free for persisted Events.

Across Topics:

- no global ordering is assumed,
- causal links MAY exist via explicit references.

Topic-local ordering is the foundation of procedural replay.

---

## 3. Idempotency

Event delivery is **at-least-once**.

Therefore:

- Projectors MUST be idempotent,
- repeated processing of the same Event or Trace observation MUST NOT corrupt state,
- deduplication MUST rely on Event/Trace identity and integrity hash, not transport guarantees.

Idempotency enables:

- retries,
- fault tolerance,
- distributed execution.

---

## 4. Durability & Reconstructibility

COP preserves and governs locally authoritative traces and reconstructible projections over them.
Native COP Events are the canonical procedural traces of COP-mediated activity.

All meaningful system state MUST be derivable from:

- the append-only Event log and the set of Artifacts (for procedural history),
- and authoritative Traces, Assertions, and EvidenceRelations (for corpus knowledge).

No critical state MAY live exclusively in:

- handler-instance memory,
- process-local variables,
- ephemeral caches, local SQLite databases, or vector stores.

Projections, materialized views, indexes, and caches are derived and non-authoritative
(`is_authoritative: false`, `is_derived: true`). If a derived view cannot be reconstructed
from authoritative source traces and policy, it is not valid COP state.

---

## 5. Stateless Handlers

Handlers MUST be stateless.

This means:

- no mutable in-memory state across events,
- no reliance on hidden local caches for correctness,
- all context must be obtained from the Store, EvidenceGraph, or Continuation payloads.

Stateless handlers enable:

- horizontal scalability,
- restartability,
- deterministic replay,
- safe evolution of agent code.

---

## 6. Isolation via Events and Packets

Handlers MUST NOT communicate directly with each other.

All coordination MUST occur via:

- Events published to the Bus,
- Artifacts referenced by Events,
- or Cognitive Packets carrying trace facts and explicit continuations.

This ensures:

- loose coupling,
- clear causality,
- inspectable interactions,
- elimination of hidden dependencies.

---

## 7. Deterministic Replay & Pure Projection

Given:

- the same ordered Event log per Topic,
- the same authoritative Traces, Assertions, and EvidenceRelations,
- the same Artifact set,
- and deterministic Projectors under the same version and policy,

replay and reconstruction MUST reconstruct the same observable state and derived views.

> **The same authoritative source set + projector version + applicable policy MUST be sufficient to reconstruct an equivalent derived view where determinism is claimed.**

Non-determinism MUST be externalized as Events, Artifacts, or explicit Assertions.

---

## 8. Epistemic Separation & Non-Amplification of Authority

A Trace is an evidential imprint, not a truth claim. Assertions represent propositions held by the
Corpus and MUST remain distinct from the Traces that support, contradict, or contextualize them.

> **Projection, summarization, consolidation, caching, or LLM synthesis MUST NOT silently amplify epistemic status or authority relative to their sources.**

- An ungrounded or low-trust trace summarized into memory remains `hypothesized` or `inferred`.
- Only an authorized Principal with active Mandate authority can designate an assertion as `normative`.
- Conflicting evidence coexists non-destructively in the `EvidenceGraph`; contradiction does not cause historical deletion.

---

## 9. The Three Temporal Coordinates

Time semantics MUST distinguish:

1. **`occurred_at` (Valid-Time / Reality Time):** When the occurrence took place in reality, handled across multiple precisions (`exact`, `day`, `month`, `year`, `interval`, `approximate`, `unknown`).
2. **`trace_created_at` (Physical Registration Time):** When the external artifact or record was created.
3. **`observed_or_ingested_at` (Corpus Ingestion Time):** When COP observed or registered the trace.

External trace ingestion MUST NOT fictionalize COP as the origin of pre-existing realities. External traces enter via `TraceObservation` events with `cop_originated: false`.

---

## 10. Schema Versioning

Events, Artifacts, Traces, Assertions, and Projections MUST carry explicit schema version identifiers.

Rules:

- new versions MUST be backward-readable,
- old versions MUST remain interpretable,
- breaking changes require explicit major versioning.

Versioning protects long-term interpretability.

---

## 11. Transparency over Convenience

COP favors:

- explicitness over hidden magic,
- durability over short-term performance,
- inspectability over opaque abstractions.

If an optimization violates an invariant, it is invalid.

### 11.1 Scope of Determinism and the Role of Human Anchors

The invariants guarantee deterministic replay of the _trace_ (Events, causal ordering, Artifacts
produced, continuation states). They do not require or promise deterministic re-execution of the
cognitive processes that generated those Artifacts.

When a handler step (human judgment or AI reasoning) is involved, the same inputs and context may
produce different outputs. This non-determinism is often valuable for exploration. What matters for
auditability and imputability is that the _trace_ — including the specific output chosen and, when
relevant, the human decision that enacted or validated it — is immutably recorded.

Consequently, for processes that carry real consequences, the presence of explicit human-enacted
decision Artifacts (see COP/HITL profile) is not optional decoration: it is the necessary anchor
that preserves imputability, skin in the game, and resistance to diffuse or hidden capture. Without
such anchors, traceability of the log remains, but accountability dissolves.

---

## 12. Governed Delegation Profiles

COP Core distinguishes protocol invariants from governance profiles. Systems in which an actor exercises consequential capabilities for a principal SHOULD additionally declare conformance with [`COP_MANDATED_AGENT_SECURITY.md`](COP_MANDATED_AGENT_SECURITY.md).

That profile formalizes the Corpus rule:

```text
operational autonomy != autonomous authority
```

and specifies mandate-version pinning, non-self-elevation, revocation/recovery semantics and capacity portability. These rules are deliberately profiled first rather than silently promoted to universal COP Core invariants before implementation experience exists.

---

## Final Note

These invariants are what make COP different.

Violating any of them may produce a working system — but not a COP system.
