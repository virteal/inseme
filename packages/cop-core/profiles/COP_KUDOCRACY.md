# COP/Kudocracy Profile

## Purpose

This profile defines a first protocol surface for public collective decisions in Kudocracy.

It derives from `research/cop_identity_kudocracy_profile.md` and should remain non-intrusive toward COP/Core.

## Initial artifact types

```text
kudocracy/public-decision
kudocracy/influence-trace
kudocracy/protection-report
kudocracy/proposal-version
```

## Initial invariants

1. Public collective decisions are immutable artifacts.
2. Corrections are represented by new events, never by mutation.
3. A public decision must reference a proposal version.
4. The acting subject, subject kind, capacity and mandate context must be explicit.
5. AI agents and digital twins may suggest, explain or compare; they must not be confused with living human decision-makers.
6. Publicity of the civic act must not imply publicity of all private data.

## Continuations

1. Add JSON schemas.
2. Add TypeScript types.
3. Add validation helpers.
4. Add projections for public decision ledgers.
5. Add protection-report workflows.
