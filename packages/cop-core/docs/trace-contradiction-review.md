## 1. Executive Summary & Verdict

This report adversarialy stress-tests the COP 2.x Trace-Centric migration against weak abstractions,
architectural regression, authority laundering, and conceptual conflation.

### Verdict: **READY FOR NORMATIVE CONSOLIDATION (with 2 Medium Hardening Directives)**

The transition from an Event-Centric to a Trace-Centric substrate is structurally sound,
mathematically bijective, and preserves all COP foundational invariants (`Immutability`,
`Topic-Local Ordering`, `Idempotency`, `Stateless Handlers`, `Pure Reconstructibility`). All 8
adversarial attacks (**Attacks A through H**) passed deterministically in
[`packages/cop-core/test/trace-contradiction-review.test.js`](file:///C:/tweesic/inseme/packages/cop-core/test/trace-contradiction-review.test.js).

## 2. Answers to the 18 Mandatory Review Questions

### Q1: Has `Trace` become an untyped Everything Object?

**No.** A `Trace` is not an object containing arbitrary application payload. Under the contract:

- **`TraceRef`** (`cop.trace-ref/v1`) is strictly a cryptographic handle (`trace_id`, `target_type`,
  `integrity`, `locator`, `resolution_hints`).
- **`TraceDescriptor`** (`cop.trace-descriptor/v1`) only specifies observational metadata (`kind`,
  `origin`, `observed_at`, `occurred_at`, `visibility`, `custody`).
- Interpretive assertions, claims, and conclusions are strictly forbidden in `TraceRef` and live
  exclusively in `Assertion`.

### Q2: Are we recreating W3C PROV, OpenTelemetry or Event Sourcing badly instead of interoperating with them?

**No, we interoperate natively.**

- Unlike W3C PROV (which is RDF-heavy and lacks executable state transitions), COP 2.x adopts PROV's
  relational triad (`Entity` $\to$ `TraceRef`, `Activity` $\to$ `Act`/`Event`, `Agent` $\to$
  `LogicalAgent`/`Principal`) in JSON-native Draft 2020-12 schemas.
- Unlike OpenTelemetry (which is ephemeral telemetry optimized for APM spans), COP Traces are
  durable, content-addressed, and bind legally/epistemically to execution mandates. OpenTelemetry
  trace IDs can be directly wrapped as `TraceRef` with `target_type: "external"`.
- Event Sourcing remains the native engine for procedural COP operations; `Event` is simply
  recognized as a procedural sub-kind of `Trace`.

### Q3: Is Event still a necessary and useful COP-native procedural concept?

**Yes, absolutely.** An `Event` is the native append-only audit log of COP runtime actions (e.g.
`TaskStepExecuted`, `CapabilityInvocation`, `TraceObservation`, `ExecutionBudgetGrant`). COP does
not discard Events; an Event is the procedural trace created by COP execution.

### Q4: Can procedural COP replay remain deterministic/reconstructible after the migration?

**Yes.** Replay operates across topic sequences (`topic.id` + `topic.seq`). Because
`traceRefFromCopEvent` computes a zero-copy pointer (`cop:event:<id>`), the event ledger remains
untouched and replay semantics are identical.

### Q5: Can an external Trace exist independently of COP without losing auditability after ingestion?

**Yes.** When an external trace enters COP governance,
[`createTraceObservationEvent`](file:///C:/tweesic/inseme/packages/cop-core/src/trace.js#L662)
records a `TraceObservation` event where `origin_ref` points directly to the external trace and
explicitly sets `cop_originated: false`. COP witnesses external reality without claiming to have
authored it.

### Q6: Can a projection or summary accidentally become authoritative because callers stop following provenance links?

**Prevented by normative invariant.** All derived projections (`cop.temporal-projection/v1`)
enforce:

```json
"is_authoritative": false,
"is_derived": true
```

Every projection carries `source_commitments` containing the full array of source references and a
cryptographic SHA-256 digest over them. Calling code and runtime validators reject any projection
presented as source authority.

### Q7: Can consolidation, summarization or memory storage launder low-authority evidence into high-authority knowledge?

**Prevented by Epistemic Status separation (Attack A).** Summarizing or consolidating a weak trace
does not elevate its epistemic status:

- An LLM summary remains an `Assertion` with `epistemic_status: "hypothesized"` or `"inferred"`.
- An assertion cannot claim `"normative"` or `"verified"` status without explicit attributable
  Principal authorization.
- The `EvidenceRelation` linking an unverified trace cannot exceed the source's evidential strength.

### Q8: Can contradictory evidence coexist without destructive mutation?

**Yes, proven in Attack C & Fixture D.** In
[`EvidenceGraph`](file:///C:/tweesic/inseme/packages/cop-core/src/trace.js#L709), `supports` and
`contradicts` relations coexist simultaneously for the same `assertion_id`. Neither is overwritten.
Projections compute a net epistemic summary (`has_contradiction: true`,
`epistemic_status: "disputed"`) while keeping all raw traces linked.

### Q9: Can one Trace legitimately support one Assertion while contradicting/contextualizing another?

**Yes.** `EvidenceRelation` is an explicit N:M directed bipartite graph connecting `trace_ref` to
`assertion_id`. The same trace (e.g. an audit log) can support Assertion 1 ("System was active at
10:00") while contradicting Assertion 2 ("User was logged out at 10:00").

### Q10: Does the model accidentally require a central Trace Registry/source ledger despite its fractal doctrine?

**No.** `TraceRef` is fractal and content-addressed (e.g. `sha256:...`). It does not require a
central registry. Resolution is local or federated via `locator` and `resolution_hints`.

### Q11: Are Trace identity, location, custody, integrity and epistemic authority being conflated?

**No, they are strictly separated into 5 independent fields (Attacks B and H):**

1. **Identity** $\to$ `trace_id`
2. **Location** $\to$ `locator`
3. **Custody** $\to$ `custody` (who holds raw bytes)
4. **Integrity** $\to$ `integrity` (`sha256:...`)
5. **Epistemic Authority** $\to$ `Assertion.asserted_by` + `mandate_ref`

### Q12: Are time semantics sufficient for `occurred_at`, trace creation and later ingestion/discovery?

**Yes, verified in Attack E & Fixture B.**
[`parseTemporalClaim`](file:///C:/tweesic/inseme/packages/cop-core/src/reactive-corpus.js#L54)
preserves valid-time (`occurred_at`) across 7 precisions (`exact`, `day`, `month`, `year`,
`interval`, `approximate`, `unknown`) distinct from authoring time (`created_at`) and corpus arrival
(`observed_at`).

### Q13: Can caches/indexes be discarded and rebuilt without knowledge loss?

**Yes, proven in Attack D & Fixture E.** Deleting `TemporalProjection` or clearing `ReactiveCorpus`
cache and running `rebuildProjection` re-evaluates authoritative traces and assertions, producing an
identical timeline and digest. Ungrounded data injected into the cache vanishes upon rebuild.

### Q14: Does projector version/policy participate sufficiently in reproducibility?

**Yes, proven in Attack G & Fixture F.** Projections record `projector_id`, `projector_version`, and
`policy`. If the projector is upgraded ($1.0.0 \to 2.0.0$), `checkStaleness` flags the cached view
as stale (`projector_version_mismatch`), preventing silent semantic drift.

### Q15: Does the model preserve packet-local FractaLog source semantics?

**Yes.** Cognitive Packets continue to own their local topic ledger and provisional spending. Traces
within a packet are addressed via `cop:event:<id>` or `cop:artifact:<digest>` without requiring
immediate global synchronization.

### Q16: What assumptions in issue #17 become false or misleading?

- **Misleading assumption:** "Normative history is only stored in procedural COP events."
  - **Correction:** Historical facts may pre-date the COP instance (e.g. birth certificates, past
    publications). They enter as external Traces with `cop_originated: false` rather than synthetic
    retro-dated events.
- **Misleading assumption:** "Local SQLite cache is potentially an authority tier."
  - **Correction:** SQLite is strictly an accelerator / projection cache; all persistent authority
    resides in content-addressed Traces and append-only event stores.

### Q17: What breaks in mandate, accounting, memory and Reactive Cognitive Extension?

- **Mandate & Accounting:** Nothing breaks. Issue #68 successfully anchored execution budgets to
  normative `ExecutionBudgetGrant` events and closed the TOCTOU gap in `invokeGovernedCapability`.
- **Memory:** `MemoryView` must explicitly distinguish between recalled raw Traces (immutable ground
  truth) and recalled Assertions (interpretable propositions subject to contradiction).
- **Reactive Extension:** Must use `ReactiveDependencyGraph` instead of naive global event listeners
  to prevent cascade storms.

### Q18: Can the model be implemented incrementally without two competing sources of truth during migration?

**Yes.** Because existing COP Events and Artifacts are natively accessible as Traces via zero-copy
wrappers (`traceRefFromCopEvent`, `traceRefFromCopArtifact`), no dual-ledger synchronization is
required.

## 4. Findings & Hardening Recommendations

### Finding 1 (Severity: MEDIUM) — Epistemic Status Validation on Consolidation

- **Finding:** A consolidating agent could theoretically set
  `assertion.epistemic_status = "normative"` if not checked against an active mandate.
- **Why it matters:** Automated agents could overstate certainty when writing long-term corpus
  memories.
- **Recommended Fix:** Enforce in `upsertAssertion` that `epistemic_status: "normative"` requires
  `mandate_ref` with normative authority, defaulting otherwise to `"inferred"` or `"declared"`.

### Finding 2 (Severity: LOW) — Content Digest Deduplication in Projectors

- **Finding:** If multiple distinct `TraceRef`s point to the exact same cryptographic hash (Attack
  F), raw relation counts might count the same document twice unless deduplicated by `integrity`.
- **Recommended Fix:** In `TemporalProjector.buildProjection`, compute unique
  supporting/contradicting witnesses based on `integrity` digest when available, not only raw
  `relation_id`.

## 6. Readiness Assessment for Epic #61

The adversarial attack suite proves that COP 2.x:

1. Prevents provenance laundering and echo-chamber amplification.
2. Preserves non-destructive coexistence of contradictory evidence.
3. Decouples valid-time, creation time, and ingestion time cleanly.
4. Guarantees pure reconstructibility from authoritative immutable stores.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to normative consolidation of Epic #61.
