# 📄 @inseme/brique-actes - Municipal Acts & Citizen Requests

**@inseme/brique-actes** is the administrative transparency module for the Inseme monorepo. It
manages the lifecycle of municipal acts and formal citizen requests.

This module ensures that administrative decisions are public, searchable, and that citizens can
track the status of their requests in real-time.

> For an overview of the ecosystem (Agora, IA, Multi-instances), see the
> [global repository README](../../README.md).

## 🎯 What is it for?

It bridges the gap between the administration and the citizens by providing a transparent workflow
for documents and requests.

### 1. 🔍 Administrative Transparency

Search and browse through municipal acts (council minutes, decrees, official notices) with full
traceability and PDF export capabilities.

### 2. 📝 Citizen Request Management

Allows citizens to submit formal requests and track their progress through a clear, logged timeline
of administrative actions.

### 3. 📊 Accountability Logs

Every action taken by an official is logged in a "Responsibility Log," ensuring high standards of
accountability and public auditability.
