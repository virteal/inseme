# @inseme/room

**@inseme/room** is the "Organic Assembly" protocol. It provides a real-time democratic space where
roles are performed, not assigned.

Designed for **Liquid Democracy**, it replaces rigid permissions with AI-assisted mediation,
allowing any group—from Municipal Councils to Co-ownerships—to self-organize, debate, and trace
decisions without bureaucracy.

## Philosophy

- **Human-First**: No hard-coded permissions. Anyone can open a session. The group decides
  legitimacy.
- **AI as Mirror**: Ophélia (the AI) observes, validates coherence, and archives history, but never
  commands.
- **Traceability**: Every action (Vote, Speech, Presence) is logged to build an unalterable history
  ("The Living Record").

## Features

- **InsemeRoom**: A full-featured assembly room component.
- **Liquid Roles**: Conflict detection instead of permission denial.
- **AI Oracle (Ophélia)**: Can answer "Who was here yesterday?" or "What was the decision on X?".
- **Deep History**: Full-text search on raw logs + Official Report generation.
- **Video Conferencing**: Native Jitsi Meet integration.
- **Liquid Voting**: Dynamic vote delegation (`bye` command).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @inseme/room
```

  return (
    <InsemeRoom
      roomName="Agora"
      user={user}
      supabase={supabase}
      config={{
        promptUrl: "/prompts/inseme.md",
