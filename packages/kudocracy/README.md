## 🎯 What is it for?

It serves as the "Rulebook" for the Inseme platform, defining how governance is structured and how
collective decisions are reached.

### 1. 🏗️ Governance Model Definitions

Defines the structure of various governance models (e.g., Liquid Democracy, Consensus-based) and
their associated parameters.

### 2. 🧩 Collective Logic

Implements the core logic for processing votes, managing delegations, and determining outcomes based
on community-defined rules.

### 3. 🛡️ Integrity Verification

Provides tools for ensuring the integrity and auditability of the decision-making process.
