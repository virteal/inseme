pnpm --filter @inseme/cop-kernel test
```

### Test Results

- **Total tests**: 179
- **Passed**: 179
- **Failed**: 0
- **Accounting conformance tests**: 32 (all passing)

---

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Protocol Types (cop-core)

- Defined TypeScript types for all accounting events (Budget, Reservation, Transaction, Reversal,
  Account)
- ExactQuantity type using decimal coefficient + scale (no binary floating-point)
- GovernanceContext with actor/principal separation and mandate linkage
- Projection types (AccountBalance, BudgetStatus, ReservationStatus, PublicKudosProjection)

### 2. JSON Schemas (cop-core)

- `base.schema.json` - Shared definitions (ExactQuantity, AccountIdentifier, Posting, etc.)
- `event.budget.schema.json` - Budget grant/amend/revoke
- `event.reservation.schema.json` - Reservation with TTL and budget reference
- `event.transaction.schema.json` - Balanced transactions with postings
- `event.reversal.schema.json` - Full/partial/compensating reversals
- `event.account.schema.json` - Account lifecycle (create/modify/suspend/close)

### 3. Validator Kernel (cop-kernel)

- Event-specific validators for each accounting event type
- Balanced posting validation (debits = credits within unit/domain)
- Cross-unit rejection without explicit conversion_rate
- Mandate compliance checking (actor vs principal)
- Budget availability checking for reservations
- Idempotency enforcement via idempotency keys
- Account identifier validation (HTTPS URL, URN, local, kudos formats)

### 4. Projector Kernel (cop-kernel)

- `projectAccountBalances()` - Derive account balances from transactions/reversals
- `projectBudgetStatus()` - Track budget granted/available/reserved/committed/spent
- `projectReservationStatus()` - Track reservation lifecycle
- `projectPublicKudos()` - Privacy-preserving public projection
- Deterministic replay (sorted by timestamp)
- Idempotency (duplicate events skipped)

### 5. Exact Quantity Arithmetic (cop-kernel)

- No binary floating-point for authoritative quantities
- `compareQuantities()`, `addQuantities()`, `subtractQuantities()`
- `fromDecimal()`, `toDecimal()` round-trip conversion
- Scale-aware operations

---

## Conformance Tests Passed

All 12 required conformance tests pass:

1. ✅ **Balanced transaction accepted** - Debits equal credits
2. ✅ **Unbalanced transaction rejected** - Atomically rejected
3. ✅ **Cross-unit balancing rejected** - Without explicit conversion_rate
4. ✅ **Duplicate delivery** - Idempotency, one accounting effect
5. ✅ **Competing reservations** - Cannot overspend budget
6. ✅ **Expired/revoked mandates rejected** - Budget status checked
7. ✅ **Reversal neutralizes effect** - Without deletion
8. ✅ **Unauthorized creation/destruction rejected** - Source/sink requires mandate
9. ✅ **Deterministic replay** - Identical state from events
10. ✅ **HTTPS account URL accepted** - `https://jhn.baronsmariani.org/`
11. ✅ **Public Kudos projection** - Excludes private details
12. ✅ **Short lifecycle representation** - No micro-events required

---

## COP Invariants Preserved

- **Immutability** - Events and Artifacts never modified; corrections via new events
- **Topic-local ordering** - Events ordered by timestamp for deterministic replay
- **Idempotency** - Duplicate delivery has one effect (via processedIdempotencyKeys tracking)
- **Durability** - All state derivable from Events
- **Stateless agents** - Projector is pure function over event stream
- **Isolation via events** - No hidden mutable state; projection is deterministic
- **Schema versioning** - All events carry schemaVersion: "1.0"
- **Transparency** - Evidence references, mandate links, disclosure classes explicit

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Reversal of type "full" without compensating_postings** - Currently only processes compensating
   reversals with explicit postings. Full reversals would require storing original transactions for
   lookup.

2. **Account identifier format validation** - Basic regex check (HTTPS URL, URN, local, kudos) but
   no full URL dereferencing or SEO metadata.

3. **Conversion rate validation** - Presence of conversion_rate checked but rate value validation
   not implemented.

4. **Evidence artifact dereferencing** - References stored but artifacts not fetched/verified.

5. **Real-time enforcement** - No atomic locking for concurrent reservations; relies on idempotency
   and re-verification.

---

## Remaining Risks

1. **Schema versioning** - Need to define migration path when "1.0" → "1.1"

2. **Cross-unit conversion** - Authorized conversions need governance model (who authorizes, how)

3. **Public projection semantics** - May need refinement for edge cases (mixed domain transactions)

4. **Performance** - Large event streams may need checkpointing/snapshotting

---

## Next Steps

1. Add COP_ACCOUNTING.md specification document (referenced but not created)
2. Implement checkpoint/resume for long-running projections
3. Add integration tests with real COP Store backend
4. Define governance workflow for conversion rate authorizations
5. Add CLI tooling for accounting state queries

## Agent Trace

**Agent**: Claude (Opus 4.8) **Principal**: Jean Hugues Robert **Mandate**: inseme issue #25
(bounded implementation) **Checks**:

- All tests pass (179/179)
- No new durable primitives introduced (Events/Artifacts only)
- Projection is storage-independent
- TypeScript compiles without errors

**Human validation needed**: Yes - Please review:

1. Schema completeness for your use cases
2. Account identifier formats (`https://jhn.baronsmariani.org/`)
3. Public projection privacy semantics
4. Evidence reference model
